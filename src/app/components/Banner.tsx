I would just stare out the window as the teachers dragged on about cells or the pythagorean theorem or whatever tedious subject we were learning that day. Every day it was 7 hours of boredom and 40 minutes of excitement, which was art class. I loved the feeling of taking a blank piece of paper and turning it into something beautiful. My love of art spilled into my other subjects as well. When creating a presentation I found myself more focused on the colour scheme or which font best suited which layout, rather than on the actual assignment. I loved figuring out how to relate the subject to the design of each slide. It would always bother me how un-aesthetically pleasing the presentations of other students and teachers were, and how I could improve them if I had the chance. Art class was the only class that I really liked. I was not always the most talented artist in the class, but I tried the hardest and I loved what I was doing.</p>
